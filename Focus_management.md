### Question 1: What is Deep Work?

Deep work means sitting and doing one important thing with full concentration. It is when we focus on a hard task without checking our phone or talking to others. For example, studying for an exam, writing an assignment, or learning something new.

When we do deep work, we understand things better because our mind is not jumping from one thing to another. It helps us do our work properly and finish it in a better way.

### Question 2: What is the optimal duration for deep work?

We cannot focus deeply for the whole day because our brain gets tired. Most people can focus deeply for a few hours in a day, around 3 to 4 hours maximum.

If someone is not used to it, they may only focus for 1 or 2 hours at first. It is better to do deep work in small time periods, like 1 hour, and then take a short break. This helps the brain stay fresh.

### Question 3: How can you implement deep work principles in your daily life?

In my daily life, I can choose a fixed time to study or work without any distractions. I can keep my phone silent and stay away from social media during that time.

I will try to do only one task at a time instead of doing many things together. After finishing my important work, I can check messages or relax.

If I practice this every day, my concentration will slowly improve and I can complete my work faster and better.

### Question 4: What are the dangers of social media?

Social media can waste a lot of time because we keep scrolling without noticing how much time has passed. It distracts us from our studies or important work.

Too many notifications break our focus again and again. Sometimes, seeing other people’s posts can also make us feel bad or stressed.

If we use social media too much, it can reduce our focus and affect our mood. So, we should use it carefully and not let it control our time.
