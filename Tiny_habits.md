# Tiny Habits & Atomic Habits – Reflection

---

## Question 1  
**Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg**  
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea for me was that change does not start with motivation, it starts with very small habits. If we make habits tiny and easy, they grow naturally over time and lead to big results.

## Question 2  
**Tiny Habits – Core Message**  
**How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A and P?**

B = MAP means Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt come together.

- **M (Motivation):** The desire to do something.  
- **A (Ability):** How easy the habit is.  
- **P (Prompt):** The reminder or trigger.  

To make habits easier, make them simple and small, and attach them to a clear prompt instead of depending only on motivation.

## Question 3  
**Why is it important to “Shine” or Celebrate after completing a habit?**

Celebrating creates a positive feeling in the brain. That good emotion helps the habit stick because the brain wants to repeat actions that feel rewarding.

## Question 4  
**1% Better Every Day – Most interesting idea**

The most interesting idea was that small improvements done consistently can create big results over time. Getting just 1% better every day leads to huge growth in the long run.

## Question 5  
**Atomic Habits – What is the book’s perspective about Identity?**

The book says real change happens when you focus on who you want to become. When you change your identity (for example, “I am a disciplined person”), your habits follow naturally.

## Question 6  
**How to make a habit easier to do?**

Break the habit into small steps and reduce friction. Make it simple and easy to start so you are more likely to do it regularly.

---

## Question 7  
**How to make a habit harder to do?**

Add friction and remove triggers. Make the bad habit inconvenient so it becomes difficult to continue.

## Question 8  
**Habit I want to do more: Daily coding**

- Keep a fixed time and laptop ready (make cue obvious).  
- Start with 20 minutes (make it easy).  
- Track progress daily (make it satisfying).  

---

## Question 9  
**Habit I want to reduce: Social media scrolling**

- Remove apps from home screen and turn off notifications (make cue invisible).  
- Log out or uninstall during work hours (make it hard).  
- Remind myself it wastes time (make it unattractive).
